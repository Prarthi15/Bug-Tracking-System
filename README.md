# Bug Tracking System using Python and SQL

* In our Bug Tracking System project, we developed a comprehensive platform using SQL and Python to streamline the process of reporting, managing, and resolving software bugs.
  
* The system catered to three user types: Admins, Experts, and Customers. Key functionalities included user authentication, customer account management, and detailed bug tracking. Admins could manage both customers and employees, while assigning bugs to experts. Experts were responsible for resolving assigned bugs and updating their status.
  
* The project utilized SQL scripts to create and manage the necessary database tables and Python for backend logic, ensuring a smooth and efficient bug tracking process
